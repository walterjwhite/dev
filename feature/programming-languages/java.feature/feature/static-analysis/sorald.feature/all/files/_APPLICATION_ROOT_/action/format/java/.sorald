S1118: Utility classes should not have public constructors (incomplete: Only handles implicit public constructor)
S1132: Strings literals should be placed on the left side when checking for equality
S1155: Collection.isEmpty() should be used to test for emptiness
S1217: "Thread.run()" should not be called directly
S1444: "public static" fields should be constant(incomplete: does not fix variable naming)
S1481: Unused local variables should be removed
S1596: "Collections.EMPTY_LIST", "EMPTY_MAP", and "EMPTY_SET" should not be used
S1656: Variables should not be self-assigned
S1854: Unused assignments should be removed
S1860: Synchronization should not be based on Strings or boxed primitives
S1948: Fields in a "Serializable" class should either be transient or serializable
S2057: Every class implementing Serializable should declare a static final serialVersionUID. (incomplete: This processor does not address the case where the class already has a serialVersionUID with a non long type.)
S2095: Resources should be closed
S2097: "equals(Object obj)" should test argument type
S2111: "BigDecimal(double)" should not be used
S2116: "hashCode" and "toString" should not be called on array instances

S2164: Math should not be performed on floats
S2167: "compareTo" should not return "Integer. MIN_VALUE"
S2184: Math operands should be cast before assignment
S2204: ".equals()" should not be used to test the values of "Atomic" classes
S2225: "toString()" and "clone()" methods should not return null (incomplete: does not fix null returning clone())
S2272: "Iterator.next()" methods should throw "NoSuchElementException"
S2755: XML parsers should not be vulnerable to XXE attacks (incomplete: This processor is a WIP and currently supports a subset of rule 2755. See Sorald's documentation for details.)
S3032: JEE applications should not "getClassLoader"
S3067: "getClass" should not be used for synchronization
S3984: Exception should not be created without being thrown
S4065: "ThreadLocal.withInitial" should be preferred
S4973: Strings and Boxed types should be compared using "equals()" *Note:* _Some rules (e.g. 1444) are marked as "incomplete". This means that Sorald's repair for a violation of said rule is either partial or situational._
